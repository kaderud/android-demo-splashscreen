# Android Demo - Splash screen

Small sample of a Material design Splash screen


This example tries to implement the Material design Launch/Splash screen. It cheats a little by not having all the drawables for various sizes, it only implements xxxhdpi, but it should
provide a basic app on how to display a splash screen in a theme.
